# Implementation of huffman coding in Kotlin
An idiomatic kotlin solution to the huffman coding algorithm. It uses the boolean[] as a datatype for storing the codes. This is the most efficient(not storage efficient) way to do it on the JVM. There are still two functions that use mutable datastructures, it would be cool to refactor them to use immutable datastructures. This is probably very possible if I just spend some more time on it. The benefit of immutability would be that this code then easily could be used in a multithreaded context. Mutability also introduces side effects in our functions, which really is an anti-pattern in kotlin.
